# Building Guide

When building large contraptions and decorations on SMP, this is how we generally do it on our server.

**Required Mods**:

- Litematica
- Item Scroller
- Litemoretica (Easy Place Protocol Version 3)
- Tweakermore
- Syncmatica

Since we build almost everything **from the bottom to the top in layers**, here is a guide on how to do that efficiently:

1. Put your Litematica in layer mode (holding `m` and pressing `pageup` or `pagedown` changes the mode)
1. Select the layer you want to build by pressing `pageup` or `pagedown`
1. Go to the Litematica Material List Feature (`m` + `l`)
1. Click the `Show` Button to change it to `Render Layers`
1. Turn on the `Info HUD` so you have an easier time collecting later
1. Refresh the Material List and make sure to press `Clear Ignored` if you have previously excluded blocks
1. Once you loaded the whole area and got your list, turn on the `AutoCollectMaterialListItem` from tweakermore. If you want to set a hotkey for that, you can get to the setting by pressing `k` + `c`.
1. Run to the shulkerboxes that contain the items of your list and just right click them once. It will show green text when you got that specific item and yellow if you did not get enough.
1. If your items don't fit into your inventory, use shulkerboxes and turn on the `pickBlockShulkers` feature in Litematica. This puts the shulker containing the item in your hand when you ran out of it in your inventory.
1. Once you end your gaming session, please also use the litematica schematic verifier (`m` + `v`) for the stuff you built. Just like in the Material List, you can set the `Show` to `Render Layers`.

For building smaller contraptions, you may want to put multiple layers at once into your inventory. To do this, you can change the render mode (`m` and pressing `pageup` or `pagedown`) to `Layer Range` and select multiple layers at a time. This also works for verifying schematics.
