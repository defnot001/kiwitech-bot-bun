# Mobswitches Guide

_Spawn those bots in survival and then make them use with the command `/player <name> use`._

**First Nether Mobswitch**: `/player nethermobswitch spawn at 3022 241 -3047 facing -90 0 in minecraft:the_nether`

**Second Nether Mobswitch**: `/player nethermobswitch2 spawn at 3022 241 -3052 facing -90 0 in minecraft:the_nether`

**First Overworld Mobswitch**: `/player owmobswitch spawn at 3002 241 -3043 facing 0 0 in minecraft:the_nether`

**Second Overworld Mobswitch**: `/player owmobswitch2 spawn at 2997241 -3043 facing 0 0 in minecraft:the_nether`

_The Endswitch Bot should be spawned in spectator mode instead. It does not use any buttons either._

**Endswitch**: `/player Endswitch spawn at 23 70 1035 facing 0 0 in minecraft:the_end`

Please make sure to kill the bots after they did what they were intended to do.

## Important

**After the server restarts and you just want to reload the mobswitches again, spawn only the nethermobswitch bot _(in spectator mode)_! If you spawn any other bot before reloading the mobswitches, it can break the chunkloaders.**
